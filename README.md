# Crossword Maker

## Inspiration

For the last few months I got really into the New York Times Daily Mini. Its just a fun way for me to start my morning and wake my brain up in a few minutes.

One day, as I was trying to come up with a birthday present idea for a friend, I thought - "Wouldn't it be great to make them a personalized crossword puzzle of words related to our shared memories?"

And so, the idea for crossword maker was born - a web application that lets you create crossword puzzles and share them with friends to solve!
