# Crossword Maker

## Inspiration

For the last few months I got really into the New York Times Daily Mini. Its just a fun way for me to start my morning and wake my brain up in a few minutes.

One day, as I was trying to come up with a birthday present idea for a friend, I thought - "Wouldn't it be great to make them a personalized crossword puzzle of words related to our shared memories?"

And so, the idea for crossword maker was born - a web application that lets you create crossword puzzles and share them with friends to solve!

## How to play

There are a few key features when creating the crossword puzzle.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr style="border: 10px transparent;">

      <b>Creation</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Go to create mode. To create new boxes 
      <br>
      first click on an existing box. Then the
      <br>
      neighboring boxes will appear. Then you can
      <br>
      select any of them to create new ones.

      <br>
      You can replace any existing letter by 
      <br>
      selecting it and typing a new letter, so
      <br>
      there is no need for deleting, eventhough 
      <br>
      it is still possible.

      existing box or block and you will 
      <br>
      see their neighbors. Select them to
