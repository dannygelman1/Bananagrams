## Inspiration

For the last few months I got really into the New York Times Daily Mini. Its just a fun way for me to start my morning and wake my brain up in a few minutes.

One day, as I was trying to come up with a birthday present idea for a friend, I thought - "Wouldn't it be great to make them a personalized crossword puzzle of words related to our shared memories?"

And so, the idea for crossword maker was born - a web application that lets you create crossword puzzles and share them with friends to solve!

## How to play

First you will land on this page where you can enter the name of your puzzle. 
You have to check if the name has already been taken first.

Then you will be sent to the editor where you can construct your puzzle. 
There are a few key features when creating the crossword puzzle.

      Go to create mode. To create new boxes 
      <br>
      first click on an existing box. Then the

      <br>
      select any of them to create new ones.

      there is no need for deleting, eventhough 
      <br>
      it is still possible.

      <br>
      existing box or block and you will 
      <br>
      see their neighbors. Select them to 
      <br>
      create them. 
    </td>
